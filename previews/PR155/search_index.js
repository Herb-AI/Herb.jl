For convenience, the programming language also offers conditionals and loops:</p></div>\n\n<pre class='language-julia'><code class='language-julia'>grammar_robots = @csgrammar begin\n    Start = Sequence                   #1\n\n    Sequence = Operation                #2\n    Sequence = (Operation; Sequence)    #3\n    Operation = Transformation          #4\n    Operation = ControlStatement        #5\n\n    Transformation = moveRight() | moveDown() | moveLeft() | moveUp() | drop() | grab()     #6\n    ControlStatement = IF(Condition, Sequence, Sequence)        #12\n    ControlStatement = WHILE(Condition, Sequence)               #13\n\n    Condition = atTop() | atBottom() | atLeft() | atRight() | notAtTop() | notAtBottom() | notAtLeft() | notAtRight()      #14\nend</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"code-output documenter-example-output\" id=\"var-grammar_robots\">1: Start = Sequence\n2: Sequence = Operation\n3: Sequence = begin\n    Operation\n    Sequence\nend\n4: Operation = Transformation\n5: Operation = ControlStatement\n6: Transformation = moveRight()\n7: Transformation = moveDown()\n8: Transformation = moveLeft()\n9: Transformation = moveUp()\n10: Transformation = drop()\n11: Transformation = grab()\n12: ControlStatement = IF(Condition, Sequence, Sequence)\n13: ControlStatement = WHILE(Condition, Sequence)\n14: Condition = atTop()\n15: Condition = atBottom()\n16: Condition = atLeft()\n17: Condition = atRight()\n18: Condition = notAtTop()\n19: Condition = notAtBottom()\n20: Condition = notAtLeft()\n21: Condition = notAtRight()\n</pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><p>This grammar specifies a simple sequential program with instructions for the robot. A couple of example programs:</p><ul><li><p><code>moveRight(); moveLeft(); drop()</code></p></li><li><p>WHILE(notAtTop(), moveUp())</p></li></ul><p>The idea behind this programming language is that the program specifies a set of transformations over a state of the robot world. Thus, a program can only be executed over a particular state. In this case, the state represents the size of the 2D world, the current position of a robot, the current position of a ball, and whether the robot is currently holding a ball. The execution of a particular instruction acts as a state transformation: each instruction takes a state as an input, transforms it, and passes it to the subsequent instruction. For example, execution of the program <code>moveRight(); moveLeft(); drop()</code> would proceed as:</p><ol><li><p>take an input state, </p></li><li><p>pass it to the <code>moveRight()</code> instruction,</p></li><li><p>pass the output of <code>moveRight()</code> to <code>moveLeft()</code> instructions,</p></li><li><p>pass the output of <code>moveLeft()</code> to <code>drop()</code>,</p></li><li><p>return the output of <code>drop()</code>.</p></li></ol><p>The following is only one possible way to implement a custom interpreter, but it demonstrates a general template that can always be followed.</p><p>We want to implement the following function, which would take in a program in the form of a <code>RuleNode</code>, a grammar, and a starting state, and return the state obtained after executing the program:</p><pre><code>    interpret(prog::AbstractRuleNode, grammar::ContextSensitiveGrammar, state::RobotState)::RobotState</code></pre><p>As <code>RuleNode</code>s only store indices of derivation rules from the grammar, not the functions themselves, we will first pull the function call associated with every derivation rule. In Julia, this is indicated by the top-level symbol of the rules. For example, the top-level symbol for the derivation rule 6 is <code>:moveRight</code>; for rule 12, that is <code>:IF</code>.</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><p>The remaining functions follow a similar idea.

The rules in the grammar can be combined to create programs.</p><p>For example, we might want to define a grammar for</p><ul><li><p>Arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Bit manipulation operations (shift left, shift right, etc.)</p></li><li><p>String manipulation operation (<code>concat</code>, <code>replace</code>, <code>findindex</code>, etc.)</p></li></ul><p>While grammars are traditionally defined in formats like BNF - below is an example of a grammar with arithmetic operations - Herb.jl takes a different approach.  </p><p>Ideally, we would want to be able to define any grammar we want in Herb. </p><p>One way to do this would be to have a file in a grammar format (e.g., BNF) that contains the grammar definition. A grammar with arithmetic operations, for example, would look like this</p><pre><code>&lt;expr&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt; \"+\" &lt;expr&gt;\n        |  &lt;term&gt;\n\n&lt;term&gt; ::= &lt;factor&gt; \"*\" &lt;term&gt;\n        |  &lt;factor&gt;\n\n&lt;factor&gt; ::= \"(\" &lt;expr&gt; \")\"\n          |  &lt;const&gt;\n\n&lt;const&gt; ::= integer</code></pre><p>A grammar only what syntactically valid programs look like - it doesn't tell us how to run them. Without a mechanism to execute programs, users would need to define both the grammar and how to evaluate programs, basically creating a new programming language from scratch.</p><p>Instead, Herb.jl leaverages Julia's built-in capabilities. Through Julia's <a href=\"https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/\">meta-programming support</a>, Herb.jl uses the Julia parser to process grammar definitions and the Julia interpreter to evaluate programs. With this approach, users can wirte the grammar directly in Julia code.</p><p>Let's look at an example of a simple grammar in Herb.jl.</p></div>\n\n<pre class='language-julia'><code class='language-julia'>using Herb</code></pre>\n\n\n<pre class='language-julia'><code class='language-julia'>grammar = @csgrammar begin\n    Number = Constant\n    Constant = 1 | 2 | 3 # constant can be 1 or 2 or 3\n    Number = x\n    Number = Number + Number\n    Number = Number - Number\n    Number = Number * Number\nend</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"code-output documenter-example-output\" id=\"var-grammar\">1: Number = Constant\n2: Constant = 1\n3: Constant = 2\n4: Constant = 3\n5: Number = x\n6: Number = Number + Number\n7: Number = Number - Number\n8: Number = Number * Number\n</pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><p>We define a grammar with six rules. When you run this code cell in a notebook, or in the Julia REPL, you notice more rules being output.  Each line in the grammar has a <code>Symbol</code> on the left-hand side, and a Julia expression on the right. The second rule exploits the <code>|</code> symbol to define multiple rules in a single line. </p><p>We can access specific rules of the grammar by their index (remember that Julia indices start from 1).

We want the search iterator that toggles between random sampling and BFS. I.e., we randomly sample programs for a given duration (for example, 2 seconds), before switching to BFS enumeration for another given duration (say 3 seconds), after which the process repeats. The BFS enumeration resumes from the previously saved state of the BFS iterator.</p><p>For this, we need the following three ingredients:</p><ol><li><p>A new iteratore type.

Iterator state</h3><p>Next, we need the iterator <code>state</code> to keep track of both running timers to make sure we switch at the right time between random sampling and BFS. A very simple way to do this is by storing the <code>start_time_random</code> of the random iterator. Then we can check in <code>iterate()</code> if the <code>current_time</code> is exceeds <code>starting time + timer_run_random</code>. We can do the same for BFS with <code>start_time_bfs</code>. To know which timer to check, we use a boolean <code>is_running_random</code>.</p></div>\n\n<pre class='language-julia'><code class='language-julia'>struct NiceCustomIteratorState\n    start_time_random::Float64\n    start_time_bfs::Float64\n    is_running_random::Bool # true while running random search, false otherwise\nend</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><h3>3.

It is a variation of the hill-climbing algorithm: Instead of always selecting the best move, SA picks a random move. If the move improves the solution (i.e., the candidate program), it is accepted.</p><p>Occasionally, SA will accept a move that worsens the solution. This allows the algorithm to escape local optima and explore more of the solution space. However, this strategy follows a cooling (annealing) schedule: at the beginning (high temperature), the algorithm explores more broadly and is more likely to accept worse solutions. As the temperature decreases, it becomes more selective, accepting worse solutions less often.</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/learn-43/lib/photoz/.g/web/glossary/anneal.html\">this page</a>.</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><p>We use the same example as for MH.

We define a context-free grammar as a <a href=\"@ref\"><code>HerbGrammar.ContextSpecificGrammar</code></a> without any constraints. A context-free grammar is just a simple set of production rules for defining combinations of terminal symbols (in our case integers). </p><p>Alternatively we could define a context-sensitive grammar, when the production rules only hold in a certain context. For more information on this, please see our tutorial on <a href=\"defining_grammars.md\">defining grammars</a>.</p><p>For now, we specify a simple grammar (using the <code>@csgrammar</code> macro) for dealing with integers and explain all the rules individually:</p><ol><li><p>First, we specify our number values and constrain them to being positive even integers.</p></li><li><p>Then, we can also use the variable <code>x</code> to hold an integer.</p></li><li><p>The third rule determines we can add two integers.</p></li><li><p>The fourth rule determines we can subtract an integer from another.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we also allow the multiplication of two integers.</p></li></ol><p>If you run this cell, you can see all the rules rolled out.</p></div>\n\n<pre class='language-julia'><code class='language-julia'>g = HerbGrammar.@csgrammar begin\n    Number = 0|2|4|6|8\n    Number = x\n    Number = Number + Number\n    Number = Number - Number\n    Number = Number * Number\nend</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"code-output documenter-example-output\" id=\"var-g\">1: Number = 0\n2: Number = 2\n3: Number = 4\n4: Number = 6\n5: Number = 8\n6: Number = x\n7: Number = Number + Number\n8: Number = Number - Number\n9: Number = Number * Number\n</pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><h3>Defining the problem</h3></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><p>As mentioned before, we are looking at example-based search.  This means that the problem is defined by a set of input-output examples.  A single example hence consists of an input and an output. The input is defined as a dictionary, with a value assigned to each variable in the grammar. It is important to write the variable name as a <code>Symbol</code> instead of a string. A <code>Symbol</code> in Julia is written with a colon prefix, i.e. <code>:x</code>.  The output of the input-output example is just a single value for this specific grammar, but could possibly relate to e.g. arrays of values, too.</p><p>In the cell below we automatically generate some examples for <code>x</code> assigning values <code>1-5</code>.</p></div>\n\n<pre class='language-julia'><code class='language-julia'># Create input-output examples\nexamples = [HerbSpecification.IOExample(Dict(:x =&gt; x), 4x + 6) for x ∈ 1:5]</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"code-output documenter-example-output\" id=\"var-examples\">5-element Vector{IOExample{Int64, Int64}}:\n IOExample{Int64, Int64}(Dict(:x =&gt; 1), 10)\n IOExample{Int64, Int64}(Dict(:x =&gt; 2), 14)\n IOExample{Int64, Int64}(Dict(:x =&gt; 3), 18)\n IOExample{Int64, Int64}(Dict(:x =&gt; 4), 22)\n IOExample{Int64, Int64}(Dict(:x =&gt; 5), 26)</pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><p>Now that we have some input-output examples, we can define the problem.  Next to the examples, a problem also contains a name meant to link to the file path, which can be used to keep track of current examples.  For now, this is irrelevant, and you can give the program any name you like.</p></div>\n\n<pre class='language-julia'><code class='language-julia'>problem_1 = HerbSpecification.Problem(\"example\", examples)</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"code-output documenter-example-output\" id=\"var-problem_1\">Problem{Vector{IOExample{Int64, Int64}}}(\"example\", IOExample{Int64, Int64}[IOExample{Int64, Int64}(Dict(:x =&gt; 1), 10), IOExample{Int64, Int64}(Dict(:x =&gt; 2), 14), IOExample{Int64, Int64}(Dict(:x =&gt; 3), 18), IOExample{Int64, Int64}(Dict(:x =&gt; 4), 22), IOExample{Int64, Int64}(Dict(:x =&gt; 5), 26)])</pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><h3>Searching</h3><p>Now that we have defined the search space and the goal of the search, we can start the search. </p><p>Of course, our problem is underdefined as there might be multiple programs that satisfy our examples.  Let us consider the case where we also have a ternary if-then-else operator and standard boolean operators in our grammar: we could synthesize the program <code>x ≤ 5 ? 3x+5 : 0</code>.  This program satisfies all our examples, but we don't expect it to generalize very well.</p><p>To search through a program space, we first need to define a <a href=\"@ref\"><code>HerbSearch.ProgramIterator</code></a>, which can be instantiated with different iterators, for now we use a simple <a href=\"@ref\"><code>HerbSearch.BFSIterator</code></a>. For more advanced search methods check out our tutorial on <a href=\".advanced_search.md\">advanced search</a>. For more information about iterators, check out our tutorial on <a href=\".working_with_interpreters.md\">working with interpreters</a>. </p><p>In general, we assume that a smaller program is more general than a larger program.  Therefore, we search for the smallest program in our grammar that satisfies our examples.  This can be done using a breadth-first search over the program/search space.</p><p>This search is very basic; it makes use of an enumeration technique, where we enumerate programs one-by-one until we find a program that matches our examples. The search procedure has a built-in default evaluator to verify the candidate programs with the given input. The search procedure also has a built-in search procedure using breadth-first search. </p><p>So, we only need to give our grammar and the problem to our search procedure, along with a starting <code>Symbol</code>, in our case a <code>Number</code>. </p></div>\n\n<pre class='language-julia'><code class='language-julia'>iterator_1 = BFSIterator(g, :Number)</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"code-output documenter-example-output\" id=\"var-iterator_1\">BFSIterator(GenericSolver(1: Number = 0\n2: Number = 2\n3: Number = 4\n4: Number = 6\n5: Number = 8\n6: Number = x\n7: Number = Number + Number\n8: Number = Number - Number\n9: Number = Number * Number\n, SolverState(Hole[Bool[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]], Set{AbstractLocalConstraint}(), true), DataStructures.PriorityQueue{AbstractLocalConstraint, Int64, Base.Order.ForwardOrdering}(), nothing, false, 9223372036854775807, 9223372036854775807))</pre>\n\n<pre class='language-julia'><code class='language-julia'>synth(problem_1, iterator_1)</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"code-output documenter-example-output\" id=\"var-hash471578\">(7{4,9{3,6}}, optimal_program)</pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><p>As you can see, the search procedure found the correct program!</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><h3>Defining the search procedure</h3><p>In the previous case, we used the built-ins of the search procedure.

We immediately pass the examples to the problem and then set up the new search.</p><p>Search is done by passing the grammar, the problem and the starting point like before. We now also specify the enumeration function to be used, and now we use depth-first search. Then, we give the maximum depth of the programs we want to search for <code>(3)</code>, the maximum number of nodes in the Abstract Syntax Tree that exists during search <code>(10)</code>, and the maximum time in seconds allowed for the search.</p></div>\n\n<pre class='language-julia'><code class='language-julia'>begin\n    problem_2 = HerbSpecification.Problem(\"example2\", [HerbSpecification.IOExample(Dict(:x =&gt; x), 168) for x ∈ 1:5])\n    iterator_2 = HerbSearch.BFSIterator(g, :Number, max_depth=4, max_size=30)\n    expr_2, flag_2 = HerbSearch.synth(problem_2, iterator_2)\n    println(expr_2)\n    program_2 = rulenode2expr(expr_2, g)\n    println(program_2)\nend</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><p>We see that our synthesizer can find a program to construct the value <code>168</code>, though a fun experiment would be trying to get the value <code>167</code>, what do you think would happen?

As said before, rules have an index associated with them.  The internal representation of programs that are defined by the grammar makes use of those indices for efficiency. Blindly removing a rule would shift the indices of other rules, and this could mean that existing programs get a different meaning or become invalid. </p><p>Therefore, there are two functions for removing rules:</p><ul><li><p><code>remove_rule!</code> removes a rule from the grammar, but fills its place with a placeholder.
