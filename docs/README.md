# Documentation of Herb.jl

This documentation was created using [Documenter.jl](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/guide/). 

## Writing documentation

The majority of the documentation of automatically generated from the respective docstrings of each sub-package. 
There are some pages that were added manually and can be edited likewise. New pages can 1. easily be written in markdown and 2. added to the site-tree by editing `docs/make.jl`. 

## Compiling the documentation
Compiling is automatically triggered whenever pushing to this branch. If you want to run the documentation locally run `julia --project=. make.jl` in this directory.
