For more advanced search methods check out our tutorial on [advanced search](.advanced_search.md). For more information about iterators, check out our tutorial on [working with interpreters](.working_with_interpreters.md). \n",

The search procedure has a built-in default evaluator to verify the candidate programs with the given input. The search procedure also has a built-in search procedure using breadth-first search. \n",
